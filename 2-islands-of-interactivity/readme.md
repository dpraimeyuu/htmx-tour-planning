### Islands of Interactivity - example
This example demonstrates combining "islands of interactivity" approach with HTMX to create a web application that includes a highly interactive map component alongside hypermedia-driven content updates.

This application includes:
* add new local tours
* add checkpoints to tours
* locate a checkpoint in the map
* view all checkpoints on an interactive map
* reorder checkpoints within a tour
* delete a tour
* delete a checkpoint from a tour
